 Objective: The objective of this React Internship Assignment is to create a new React application
that implements the following functionality:


Task 1: Application Configuration
● Create a new React application using Typescript and Vite.
● If you are unfamiliar with Vite, please refer to the following link for more information:
https://vitejs.dev/guide/
● Configure the application with MUI, ensuring that all components within the application (e.g.
buttons, text fields, dialogs) use MUI components. If you are unfamiliar with MUI, please refer
to the following link for more information:
https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/
Task 2: First Page of the Application
● Create a form to collect the following information from the user:
○ Name
○ Phone number
○ Email
● Upon completion, save the user details in localstorage and route the user to the second page.
● If the user attempts to access the second page without providing the necessary information,
redirect them back to the first page with a message indicating that they must enter their
details before accessing the page.
Task 3: Second Page of the Application[Component 1]
● Fetch a list of JSON details from an API. You may use any API that returns a list of data. One
example is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
● Convert the retrieved JSON data into a model/interface in Typescript. If you are unfamiliar
with models or interfaces in Typescript, please refer to the following link for more information:
https://www.educative.io/blog/typescript-interfaces
● Display the data in a table using the following package: https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/
Task 4: Second Page of the Application[Component 2]
● Create another component below the table from the given
json(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQCFny5aXfMD9v2TPy3rbE8EHw-xZVdZfj4g-2Yv6I
U/edit?usp=sharing)
● You can hardcode the given json in your application
● The component will be the list of department and each department has sub departments
● Sub departments can be expanded and collapsed by the use
